# NodeJS Blockchain

## This is almost a POC (Proof Of Concept) demonstrating a very basic implementation of the [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) principle in NodeJS.

### Installation:
1. Clone the repository using **git clone https://github.com/MedUnes/NodeBlockchain.git**
2. Run the blockchain.sql file on your MySQL server **before anything (important)**
3. Set your MySQL server's credentials (user/password) by editing the** config/keys.js** file.
4. Install node modules using **npm install**

### Usage:
Run the application using **node app.js** 

P.S: As this is a very early stage work, POC, just play with the **app.js** file to change the **data** property of the block object and see how it affects the database. To be continued..
